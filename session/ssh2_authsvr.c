/* SSH user authentication gets quite complicated because of the way that 
   the multi-pass dog's-breakfast process defined in the spec affects our 
   handling of user name and password information.  The SSH spec allows the 
   client to perform authentication in bits and pieces and change the 
   details of what it sends at each step and use authentication methods 
   that it specifically knows the server can't handle and all manner of 
   other craziness, see the SimpleSSH draft for a long discussion of these 
   problems.  
   
   This is particularly nasty because of the large amount of leeway that it 
   provides for malicious clients to subvert the authentication process, for 
   example the client can supply a privileged user name the first time 
   around and then authenticate the second time round as an unprivileged 
   user.  If the calling application just checks the first user name that it 
   finds then it'll then treat the client as being an authenticated 
   privileged user which indeed some server applications have done in the 
   past.
   
   To defend against this we record the user name and any other state-based
   information the first time that they're provided and from then on require 
   that the client supply the same information on subsequent authentication 
   attempts.  This is the standard client behaviour anyway, if the user 
   name + password are rejected then the assumption is that the password is 
   wrong and the user gets to retry the password.  We don't allow retry on
   public-key authentication because the signature isn't going to change on
   subsequent attempts.
   
   In order to accommodate public-key authentication we also verify that the 
   authentication method remains constant over successive iterations, i.e. 
   that the client doesn't try part of an authentication with a public key 
   and then another part with a password.  Finally, we enforce a state 
   machine that only allows messages in a certain sequence.

   Handling the state machine required to process all of this gets rather
   complicated, the protocol flow that we enforce is:

	Step 0 (optional, MobaXTerm can be used to test the full none -> pk_ok 
			-> pk_auth flow):

		Client sends SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST with method "none" to query 
		available authentication method types.

		Server responds with SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE listing available 
		methods.

	Step 0a (optional):

		Client sends SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST with only a public key, no
		signature.

		Server responds with SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK.  We always respond with 
		PK_OK in order to prevent account enumeration.

	Step 1:

		Client sends SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST with method "password" or 
		"publickey" and password data or a digital signature as appropriate.

	Step 2, one of:

		a. Server responds with SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS and the 
		authentication exchange terminates.

		b. Server responds to method "password" with 
		SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE, the client may retry step 1 if permitted 
		by the server as described in the SSH specification.

		c. Server responds to method "publickey" with 
		SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE and the authentication exchange terminates.

   This is a simplified form of what's given in the SSH spec, which allows
   almost any jumble of messages including ones that don't make any sense 
   (again, see the SimpleSSH draft for more details - if any aspiring 
   academic is looking for an easy-win publication, try attacking this 
   dog's-breakfast exchange process).  
   
   The credential-type matching that we perform in processUserAuth() is 
   indicated by the caller supplying one of the following values:

	NONE_PRESENT: No existing user name or password to match against, store 
		the client's user name and password for the caller to check.

	USERNAME_PRESENT: Existing user name present from a previous iteration 
		of authentication, match the client's user name to the existing one 
		and store the client's password for the caller to check.

	USERNAME_PASSWORD_PRESENT: Caller-supplied credentials present, match 
		the client's credentials against them.

	USERNAME_PUBKEY_PRESENT: Partial public-key authentication started in 
		the previous round, complete the public-key authentication */

typedef enum {
	CREDENTIAL_NONE,		/* No credential information type */
	CREDENTIAL_NONE_PRESENT,/* No credentials present */
	CREDENTIAL_USERNAME_PRESENT,
							/* User name is present and must match */
	CREDENTIAL_USERNAME_PASSWORD_PRESENT,
							/* User/password present and must match */
	CREDENTIAL_USERNAME_PUBKEY_PRESENT,
							/* User/public key present and must match */
	CREDENTIAL_LAST			/* Last possible credential information type */
	} CREDENTIAL_TYPE;

/* The processUserAuth() function has multiple possible return values, 
   broken down into CRYPT_OK for a password match, OK_SPECIAL for something 
   that the caller has to handle, and the standard error status, with 
   subvalues given in the userAuthInfo variable.  The different types and
   subtypes are:

	CRYPT_OK + uAInfo = USERAUTH_SUCCESS: User credentials present and 
		matched. Note that the caller has to check both of these values, one 
		a return status and the other a by-reference parameter, to avoid a 
		single point of failure for the authentication.

	OK_SPECIAL + uAInfo = USERAUTH_CALLERCHECK: User credentials not 
		present, added to the session attributes for the caller to check.

	OK_SPECIAL + uAInfo = USERAUTH_NOOP: No-op read for a client query of 
		available authentication methods via the pseudo-method "none".

	OK_SPECIAL + uAInfo = USERAUTH_NOOP_2: Additional no-op read for a 
		client partial public-key authentication without a signature, 
		requiring another round of messages to get a public-key 
		authentication with a signature.

	Error + uAInfo = USERAUTH_ERROR: Standard error status, which includes 
		non-matched credentials */

typedef enum {
	USERAUTH_NONE,			/* No authentication type */

	USERAUTH_LAST			/* Last possible authentication type */
	} USERAUTH_TYPE;

/* The state of progress through the authentication process, used to 
   indicate special handling for the first message from the client and the
   need for a fatal authentication failure rather than a retry request for
   the last authentication attempt that we allow.  There's also a special
   password-only progress state to indicate that retries are allowed but
   only for passwords */

typedef enum {
	AUTHSTATE_NONE,			/* No authentication state */
	AUTHSTATE_FIRST_MESSAGE,/* First message from client */
	AUTHSTATE_IN_PROGRESS,	/* Authentication in progress */
	AUTHSTATE_IN_PROGRESS_PWONLY,/* In progress but only passwords */
	AUTHSTATE_FINAL_MESSAGE,/* Final message allowed from client */
	AUTHSTATE_LAST			/* Last possible authentication state */
	} AUTHSTATE_TYPE;

/* The client sends the following as the first part of each message, 
   representing a query, password authentication, or public-key 
   authentication:

	byte	type = SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
	string	user_name
	string	service_name = "ssh-connection"
	string	method_name = "none" | "password" | "publickey"
	[...]

   Handling of the case where two different user names are supplied in 
   different messages gets a bit tricky because if both names are present in 
   the list of set-by-the-caller credentials then we'll get a successful 
   match both times even though a different user name was used.  To detect 
   this we record the initial user name in the SSH session information and 
   check it against subsequently supplied values.  We do the same for the 
   keyID for public-key authentication.
   
   In this case the "Store" for the username/keyID in the tables below means 
   that it's recorded for future rounds of authentication to allow for 
   consistency checks denoted by "Check", but not added to the session 
   attributes, while "Add" means that it's added to the session attributes 
   and matched with "Match".  

   If an error status is returned then any value other than 
   CRYPT_ERROR_WRONGKEY for passwords is treated as a fatal error.  
   CRYPT_ERROR_WRONGKEY for a password is nonfatal as determined by the 
   caller, for example until some predefined retry count has been exceeded.

   These are the match options with a caller-supplied list of username+
   password credentials to match against, the letter and number corresponds
   to locations in the code where that condition is enforced:

	Client sends | Credentials	| Action					| Result
				 | present		|							|
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "pass" | _USERNAME_PW	| Store name				|			 A1
				 |				| Match name, password		| SUCCESS/ERROR

	Name, "none" | _USERNAME_PW	| Store name				| NOOP		 A2
	Name, "none" | _USERNAME_PW	| Error						| ERROR (fatal)
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "none" | _USERNAME_PW	| Store name				| NOOP		 A3
	Name, "pass" | _USERNAME_PW	| Check/match name, password| SUCCESS/ERROR

	Name, "pass" | _USERNAME_PW	| Store/match name, wrong	|			 A6
		  (wrong}|				|	password -> Fail		| ERROR
	Name,"pubkey"| _USERNAME_PW	| Error						| ERROR (fatal)

   The match options with no caller-supplied list of credentials to match 
   against are:

	Client sends | Credentials	| Action					| Result
				 | present		|							|
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "pass" | _NONE		| Store/add name, password	| CALLERCHECK B1
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "none" | _NONE		| Store/add name			| NOOP		 B2
	Name, "none" | _USERNAME	| Error						| ERROR (fatal)
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "none" | _NONE		| Store/add name			| NOOP		 B3
	Name, "pass" | _USERNAME	| Check/match name,			|
				 |				|	add password			| CALLERCHECK
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "none" | _NONE		| Store/add name			| NOOP		 B4
	Name2, "pass"| _USERNAME	| Check name2 -> Fail		| ERROR (fatal)
	-------------+--------------+---------------------------+--------------
	Name, "pass" | _NONE		| Store/add name, password	| CALLERCHECK
		  (wrong)|				|							|			 B5
	Name, "pass" | _USERNAME	| Check/match name,			|
				 |				|	update password			| CALLERCHECK

	Name, "pass" | _NONE		| Store/add name, password	| CALLERCHECK
		  (wrong)|				|							|			 B6
	Name,"pubkey"| _USERNAME	| Error						| ERROR (fatal)

   Finally the match options for public-key authentication, these are 
   dependent on the presence of a public-key database rather than a list of 
   credentials (or lack thereof).  We don't list things like the Name/Name2
   sequence because they're already handled as part of the password 
   processing above and it would make the table rather large with all of the
   extra states.

/* A lookup table for the authentication methods submitted by the client.  

   Some servers also do "keyboard-interactive" (misnamed PAM) which extends
   the dog's-breakfast to throw in breakfast for all of its puppies as well, 
   this can among other things be used as an alternative for password 
   authentication but we don't support it because we already do passwords
   and it just makes the authentication mess even bigger and harder to 
   handle safely.
   
   There's also a "hostbased" authentication type which is just public-key
   authentication without allowing all of the Lucy-and-Charlie-Brown steps
   but also adding the remote host name and user name on that host.  The 
   idea is that there's a single key used for the remote host and that 
   vouches for all users on it, a bit like rhosts.  Since most of our usage
   is for machine-to-machine comms we could in theory add this because
   there's only ever one host and one (pseudo-)user on it so it just becomes
   a differently-labelled public-key authentication, but so far everyone's
   just used actual public-key authentication in this role */

		   authentication anyway:
			   
			byte	type = SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK
			string	pubkey_algorithm_from_request
			string	pubkey_data_from_request
		
		   There's no obvious reason for this process, and no implementation 
		   that bothers with this additional unnecessary step appears to 
		   check the returned data except for OpenSSH, and even that only 
		   checks it as an implementation artefact.  
			   
		   What OpenSSH does is throw every key it has available at the 
		   server until it finds one that sticks, however it doesn't 
		   remember which key was sent in which request but relies on the 
		   server's response to tell it which one it was.  It's likely that 
		   this message only exists as an OpenSSH quirk that got written 
		   into the spec, and as implemented in OpenSSH it allows a server 
		   to request authentication from a key other than the one the 
		   client thinks it's using by sending back an ACK for key B when 
		   the client has proposed key A.
		   
		   This also makes it very easy to fingerprint users, and there's 
		   even a demo SSH server that does this, 
		   https://github.com/FiloSottile/whoami.filippo.io, greeting you by 
		   name when you connect via SSH (no user interaction required) and 
		   have your name on Github.
			   
		   There was an attempt to fix the OpenSSH problem in 2021 by 
		   forcing the issue with a CVE, see
		   https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/270#issuecomment-920577097,
		   but the OpenSSH maintainers rejected the patch, so it looks like 
		   it'll be with us in perpetuity.

		   Because only OpenSSH appears to bother checking this message, we 
		   send back an easter egg for any other implementation to catch 
		   anything that we're not currently aware of that does actually 
		   check what's coming back.  Throughout the entire time this code

   want to make it vulnerable to a simple boolean control-variable overwrite

   reference value, we require the two values to be different (one a zero

   separated by a canary that's also checked when the status values are
   checked.  In theory it's still possible to overwrite this if an exact
   pattern of 96 bits (on a 32-bit system) can be placed in memory, but this
   is now vastly harder than simply entering an over-long user name or 
   password that converts an access-granted boolean-flag zero value to a 
   nonzero value.
